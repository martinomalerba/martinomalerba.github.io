    "text": "Welcome to AusDams.org! Australia’s free interactive portal dedicated to farm dams.\nFarm dams are vital assets in Australia’s agricultural landscape, yet comprehensive data about their number, size, and impacts remain surprisingly scarce. AusDams.org bridges this gap by offering open access to detailed, interactive data on Australian farm dams, empowering communities, researchers, and policymakers to make informed decisions.\nWhy Farm Dams Matter\nAustralia is the world’s second driest continent, making freshwater an essential resource for our agriculture, economy, and ecosystems. Farm dams, though small individually, collectively hold significant water reserves, drive $17.7 billion in agricultural value, and profoundly affect biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and nutrient cycles.\nOur research reveals there are approximately 1.76 million farm dams across Australia, covering an area larger than Rhode Island (4,678 km²), storing more than 20 times the volume of Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). Yet around 11% remain undocumented, highlighting the urgency for better monitoring and management.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nFarm dams significantly contribute to Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions, producing approximately 41 kilotons of methane (CH₄) annually. Installing fences to exclude livestock can reduce methane emissions dramatically—by 56% to 92%. This simple action improves water quality, reducing dissolved nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus by up to 57%, and increasing dissolved oxygen levels, significantly lowering emissions further.\nSupporting Biodiversity\nWell-managed farm dams play a crucial role in conserving biodiversity, particularly amphibians, birds, and reptiles. Farm dams that are older (&gt;20 years), intermediate in size (~0.1 ha), and close to other freshwater systems or conservation areas support significantly higher biodiversity. These dams serve as refuges for threatened species, highlighting their potential as biodiversity hotspots and their importance in ecological restoration initiatives and biodiversity credit programs.\nHow to Use the Interactive Portal\n\nChoose Display Colors: Select how farm dams are colored on the map, either by region, map classification, or descriptive attributes.\nSelect Point Size: Customize how each farm dam’s size is represented on the map—by area, perimeter, or water capacity.\nNavigate or Click: Move around the map to your region of interest or simply click one of the polygons to instantly generate regional statistics.\n\nUse the bottom-left graph to view detailed statistics including:\n\nDistribution of farm dam areas (in m²)\nTime-series of monthly temperatures (°C)\nAverage % water capacity (0% empty to 100% full)\nTime-series of water surface area (m²)\nFarm dam count over time\nMethane emission factor (methane per ha per year)\nTotal methane emissions (methane per year)\nFarm dam density (dams per ha)\n\nYou can also access our Data Explorer to view underlying data summaries by Local Government Authorities or individual dams.\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to improve Australia’s water security and ecological sustainability through accessible data. AusDams.org is continuously updated with cutting-edge research, ensuring you have the most reliable information at your fingertips.\nExplore the map, generate custom statistics, and join us in transforming data into sustainable practices.\nWho We Are\n\nMartino Malerba – martino.malerba@rmit.edu.au\nNicholas Wright – nicholas.wright@dpird.wa.gov.au\nPeter Macreadie – peter.macreadie@deakin.edu.au\n\nGet in Touch\nWe welcome your feedback and collaboration.

    "text": "About our research\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship Between Farm Dam Surface Area and Water Capacity\nThis graph shows how you can estimate the water-holding capacity of a farm dam based on its surface area. Data from 558 farm dams across Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland indicate a strong relationship between the dam’s area and its total water capacity. These measurements were obtained using advanced mapping technologies (satellite imagery and laser scanning). Read more in Malerba et al. (2021, Remote Sensing).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of Documented Farm Dams Across Australia\nThis map shows the density and total number of documented farm dams across Australian states and territories. Colours represent how many dams are found per square kilometre, with empty spaces indicating areas without recorded dams. Read more in Malerba et al. (2021, Remote Sensing).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Benefits of Fencing Farm Dams for Water Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nInstalling fences around farm dams significantly improves water quality by preventing livestock from depositing manure directly into the water and reducing disturbance to the soil and vegetation. Compared to unfenced dams, fenced dams have fewer dissolved nutrients, higher levels of dissolved oxygen, and notably lower methane emissions. Read more in Malerba et al. (2022, Global Change Biology).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Farm Dam Features that Support Frog Biodiversity\nThis illustration summarises which characteristics of farm dams best support frog species richness. Older dams (over 20 years), medium-sized (around 0.1 hectares), with small rainfall catchments, located near other water bodies and conservation areas, and experiencing moderate temperatures and high rainfall provide the best habitats for frogs. Conversely, very large dams, isolated dams, and those in extreme climates support fewer frog species. Read more in Malerba et al. (2023, Biological Conservation)."
